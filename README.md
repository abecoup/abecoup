Hi there, Iâ€™m @abecoup.

I'm currently working through JavaScript30 by Wes Bos with the aim of further solidifying my understandings of the DOM, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. In conjuction with JavaScript30 I am completing Kent C. Dodds course "The Beginner's Guide to React" at egghead.io that covers: React basics, the what/how of JSX, building forms, state management using hooks, and more. On top of learning more about web-technologies, I've been spending my time practicing and reviewing data structures and algorithms problems to improve/sharpen my coding and problem solving skills.

Next semester marks the start of my second year at RIT where i'll be jumping into courses like Software Architecture and Software Quality Assurance. I will also be conducting research focused on agile story point estimation using machine learning.

Hi there, Iâ€™m @abecoup.

I'm currently a graduate software engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology conducting research focused on agile story point estimation using machine learning. I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science from Clarkson University at 21yo and strive every day to learn more, do more, and be more than yesterday's me.
